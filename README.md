# Tumblr â€“ Custom Dashboard Palette

### **Use alongside [Old Tumblr Dashboard (2023) by Pixiel](https://userstyles.world/style/11286/old-tumblr-dashboard-2023) to get the old dashboard layout back.**

## About
Just a simple userstyle for setting custom colors, font sizes, and font family for the tumblr dashboard. Supports full and tiling backgrounds.

This theme will update automatically when I make changes to the code here on github if you have auto update enabled in Stylus. The default theme is inspired by the old dashboard and uses its old blue hue.

### Notes:
* This style will only change the look of the beta post editor, the new dashboard, and any other pages that have been updated to use the new layout.
* Most of the options are self-explanatory, but there are a few that might need clarification:
  * **Alt Nav Styling** = Changes the look of the left hand column since the large solid bar can be ugly, especially with custom backgrounds. Allows for no BG or a list of rounded pills.
  * **Dashboard Tabs** = See screenshot #2. If you're on a newer version of the dashboard, there is now a set of tabs under the post creation tools that allows you to switch between different 'feeds' of posts directly on the dashboard. The defaults are Following and Suggested Posts, but more experimental feeds can be added via Tumblr Labs. The dash shows your Following feed by default, so this option exists to allow you to hide the tabs menu if you don't like it/won't use it.
  * **Layout Fixes for Custom Backgrounds** = Adds solid backgrounds to many sidebar/header elements and pages (ex. the activity page) that don't have them by default.
  * **Modal Color** = The color of the semi-transparent overlay that appears when you open up the post editor, go to delete a post, block someone, etc.
  * **Menus Hover BG Color** = the bg color that appears when hovering over some menu options. Places it's currently used: activity popup, messaging list popup, activity page, following & followers pages.
  * **Modal Reccomendations** = when clicked to view full size, some images now suggest similar posts directly inside the modal itself underneath the fullsize picture. this toggle gives you the option to hide or show these suggested posts.
  * **Inline Recommendations** = this will hide the following inline recommendations:
      * bonecoin ad / answertime link
      * inline blog suggestions ('check out these blogs')
      * inline tag suggestions on /tagged/ pages
      * the 'You're caught up. Check these out' carousel
  * This theme will NOT hide 'In Your Orbit', 'Based On Your Likes', or 'Because You Follow #Tag' posts, but these can all be disabled via toggles found [on this page of the tumblr account settings.](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/dashboard)
