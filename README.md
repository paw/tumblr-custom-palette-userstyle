Most of the options are self-explanatory, but there are a few that might need clarification:
* **Modal Color** = the color of the overlay when you open up the post editor, go to delete a post, block someone, etc.
* **Menu Hover BG Color** = the bg color that appears when hovering over options in the settings dropdown, as well as when hovering over blogs on the following/followers page
* **Follower Notifications** = the custom background color for notifications from people you follow
