# Tumblr â€“ Custom Dashboard Palette

Just a simple userstyle for setting custom colors, font size, and font family for the tumblr dashboard. This theme will update automatically when I make changes to the code here on github. The default theme is inspired by the old dashboard and uses its old blue hue.

### Notes:
* This style will only change the look of the beta post editor, the new dashboard, and any other pages that have been updated to use the new layout.
* Most of the options are self-explanatory, but there are a few that might need clarification:
  * **Fix for Custom BG Images** = Adds solid backgrounds to many sidebar/header elements and pages (ex. the activity page) that don't have them by default.
  * **Modal Color** = The color of the semi-transparent overlay that appears when you open up the post editor, go to delete a post, block someone, etc.
  * **Menu Hover BG Color** = the bg color that appears when hovering over options in the settings dropdown, as well as when hovering over blogs on the following/followers pages and when hovering over notifications.
  * **Follower Notifications** = the custom background color for notifications from people you follow.
